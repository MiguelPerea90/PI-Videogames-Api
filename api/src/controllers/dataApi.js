    "description": "<p>Rockstar Games went bigger, since their previous installment of the series. You get the complicated and realistic world-building from Liberty City of GTA4 in the setting of lively and diverse Los Santos, from an old fan favorite GTA San Andreas. 561 different vehicles (including every transport you can operate) and the amount is rising with every update. <br /> Simultaneous storytelling from three unique perspectives: <br /> Follow Michael, ex-criminal living his life of leisure away from the past, Franklin, a kid that seeks the better future, and Trevor, the exact past Michael is trying to run away from. <br /> GTA Online will provide a lot of additional challenge even for the experienced players, coming fresh from the story mode. Now you will have other players around that can help you just as likely as ruin your mission. Every GTA mechanic up to date can be experienced by players through the unique customizable character, and community content paired with the leveling system tends to keep everyone busy and engaged.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed by Valve Corporation and released on April 19, 2011 on Steam, PS3 and Xbox 360. It was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts in physical form. </p> <p>Its plot directly follows the first game&#39;s, taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...</p> <p>Portal 2&#39;s core mechanics are very similar to the first game&#39;s ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.</p> <p>The game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.</p> <p>Portal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor.</p>",

Heavily influenced by Naughty Dog’s “Uncharted”, the game is a mix of everything, from stealth and survival to combat and QTE action scenes.<br /> Young Lara Croft arrives on the Yamatai, lost island near Japan, as the leader of the expedition in search of the Yamatai Kingdom, with a diverse team of specialists. But shipwreck postponed the successful arrival and seemingly forgotten island is heavily populated with hostile inhabitants, cultists of Solarii Brotherhood.<br /> The game will be graphic at times, especially after failed QTE’s during some of the survival scenes, but overall players will enjoy classic action adventure, reminiscent of the beginning of the series. This game is not a direct sequel or continuation of existing sub-series within the franchise, but a reboot, setting up Tomb Raider to represent modern gaming experience.<br /> The game has RPG elements and has a world, which you can explore during the story campaign and after the completion. As well as multiplayer mode, where 2 teams (4 scavengers and 4 survivors) are clashing in 3 game modes while using weapons and environments from the single-player campaign.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Interactive storytelling and plot-heavy games gained popularity, and “Life is Strange” arrived as teen mystery adventure. The plot will go through the life of Maxine, a teenager in possession of curious power, allowing her to stop and rewind time, in order to manipulate her surroundings. Max, after the reunion with her friend Chloe, is on the path to uncovering the secrets of Arcadia Bay. Players will have to deal with puzzle solving through the fetch quests, in order to change the world around them. <br /> The game puts players in situations, where they’re forced to make a moral choice, going through the decision which may have short-term or long-term consequences. Every choice made by the player will trigger the butterfly effect, surrounding the first playthrough of the game with a lot of emotional struggle, thoughtfully crafted by the developers at Dontnod Entertainment. Life is Strange is third person adventure game, where players might seem just as an observer of the stories, unfolding in front of them.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Gordon Freeman became the most popular nameless and voiceless protagonist in gaming history. He is painted as the most famous scientist and a hero within the world of Half-Life, and for a good reason. In the first game he saved the planet from alien invasion, this time, when the invasion is already begun, the world needs his help one more time. And you, as a player, will help this world to survive. This time Gordon arrives in City 17, ravaged and occupied by Combines, where he meets his old Black Mesa friends. <br /> What is different, aside from the overall design quality, is the use of Valve’s Source engine that not only expands on the fluidity of character model animations and movement but allows players to interact with a myriad of objects with the advanced and realistic (to an extent) physics. Classic Headcrab Zombies are revamped and have new variants that provide players with different threats. For a story-driven FPS, Half-Life 2 is unique in its plot delivery, and making in-game mechanics feel natural, be it platforming or driving.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This popular 2D puzzle-platformer creates the atmosphere of isolation, where the player alone can guide the nameless protagonist to his destination. Hostile environments and one-hit deaths may seem difficult, but the game implements a fair amount of checkpoints. The monochrome color palette showcases cartoony proportions of every living thing while making lack of details threatening. Limbo shows you exactly what you encounter, but never how it looks.</p> <p>Limbo uses the atmosphere and sound design of the horror genre while avoiding tropes of the modern horror games. The overarching theme and unique style compensated for the rather short game with an abrupt ending, making Limbo one of the most impactful games for the genre.</p> <p>The simple controls and easy-to-pick-up mechanics help to make a clear distinction, which part of the stage players can interact with, and which part can lead to the quick death. Even though the game is in black and white, this separation is intuitive and natural, so the player would know exactly where to go or what to do.</p>",

With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. </p> <p>With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling.

The main target is all that matters, and you can do anything to kill this person in your style and fashion. You can disguise as a different person and infiltrate secured area to perform the kill manually or use a long-range sniper rifle to do the trick. Your surroundings help you a lot as well by listening to nearby chat or news reports. Players are given as much freedom as possible to find your professional style in the art of killing. A large amount of DLC and expanded missions can either give you gimmick-based contracts and travel to Japan, Serbia and other countries.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania-type game developed by an indie studio named Team Cherry.</p> <p>Most of the game&#39;s story is told through the in-world items, tablets, and thoughts of other characters. Many plot aspects are told to the player indirectly or through the secret areas that provide a bit of lore in addition to an upgrade. At the beginning of the game, the player visits a town of Dirtmouth. A town built above the ruins of Hallownest. The players descend down into the ruins to find some answers to his questions.</p> <p>The game revolves mainly around the exploration of the in-game world, which requires the players to have some platforming skills. The players have to find secrets that are scattered around the level and battle their enemies. There is a certain degree of backtracking in the game as some areas are locked until the player defeats a certain boss or picks up a specific item. Each area changes as the plot advances so it may be surprising to come back in a certain area. </p> <p>The Protagonist uses a nail which serves as a replacement for a sword. Players can attack in four directions. The nail is upgradable.</p>",

The setting includes numerous high-rise buildings designed specifically for Spider-Man&#39;s movements.</p> <p>As the player progresses, he or she unlocks new suits that grant Spider-Man new abilities, such as additional attacks or enhanced Spider-Sense. The abilities are not tied to the suits, however, and the player can use the suit of his or her choice without losing the ability. The combat system is similar to that in Batman: Arkham, in that Spider-Man fights many opponents in hand-to-hand combat but avoids killing them.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Carefully constructed horror game relies on positioning, camera work, and shocking content. But Amnesia: The Dark Descent adds psychological elements to it. Players control the young man named Daniel, who wakes up in a seemingly empty castle, alone and with a massive memory loss. Through environmental storytelling, notes, audio logs and even visions, players are invited to uncover the deep-rooted secrets of the castle. <br /> Throughout the game players will be introduced to the mechanics of Sanity, representing the mental state of Daniel which can be affected by lack of light, visions and even unpleasant encounters with the monsters. When decreased, Sanity will distort the vision of the player to a different and seemingly random effect, in order to depict actual effects of severe anxiety. Most of the game challenges are completed through the item search and physics puzzles, forcing players to be resourceful and courageous.<br /> The game supports modding, and allows user-created content alongside the free DLC Justine, telling a story of a female prisoner. Given how short the DLC story is - several possible endings are available.</p>",

Action-adventure with horror elements, Alan Wake is paced like a thriller show, cinematic and slow, which is in alignment with the visual style of the rural region of Washington and linear storytelling. The main enemy, encountered by the players will be Taken – possessed by darkness creatures and humans that cannot be attacked outright, because they are shrouded in black smoke, blocking the attacks. Only after dispelling the darkness with a source of light players are able to affect the enemies. When the enemies are getting too close, Alan can perform a slow-motion dodge.<br /> Two more episodes were published for the first game, called “The Signal” and “The Writer”, directly continuing the story of the main game, and completing the first season.</p>",

They questioned if the experience was complete because the first Half-Life included multiplayer mode from the beginning. Valve took the criticism and published Half-Life 2: Deathmatch – multiplayer only addition, based on the main game, which was a separate product, distributed on Steam. <br /> The game includes two major modes, which are Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. Both modes have similar rules. Players must kill as many other players as possible, to gain points. Player or team with the most points win, and points are retracted for self-killing and team killing. Players can expect fast-paced matches with instant respawns.</p>",

While the base game is reminiscent of GTA type of games mechanically, shifting tone and frantic story create the comedic and exciting atmosphere. A long line of DLC adding to the game not only unique missions, even by the Saints Row standards, but customization items, transport, and outfits.

    "description": "<p>Half-Life is the original game in the series. Being a revolutionary at the time, we follow the story of Gordon Freeman - a silent scientist at the facility called Black Mesa. Arriving late at work and hastily doing his routine he runs into the experiment field. However, the experiment goes completely wrong and opens a portal to a completely different dimension called Xen. The laboratory is destroyed as well as the facility itself, as unknown creatures like Vortigaunts are now everywhere in the facility. Gordon must battle his way to the surface and find a way to close the portal.</p> <p>One of the main features of Half-Life was story-telling through scripted sequences within the actual gameplay. Without having cutscenes, the game was able to tell the full story of the game by showing scripted deaths, dialogues, character appearance while the gameplay was moving one. By not ripping off the player from the process, the game feels much more smooth as it continues. Despite his science nature, Gordon is masterfully using his weapons and destroys any enemy at his path with rifles, grenades, shotguns and much more.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The hero (in the beginning you can choose gender, name and appearance) - an office worker who inherited an abandoned farm. The landscape of the farm can also be selected. For example, you can decide whether there will be a river nearby for fishing.<br /> The farm area needs to be cleared, and it will take time.<br /> The hero has many different activities: plant and care for plants, raise livestock, practice crafts, extract ore, and also enter into relationships with residents of the neighbouring town to earn game money. Relationships with characters include communication, performing tasks for money, exchanging, searching for fossils and even military actions and marrying. The character is limited by the reserve of strength and health - both parameters are visible on the screen, and the game automatically puts the hero to rest if the limit of his capabilities is close. The game does not set any ultimate or primary goal, its many possibilities are designed for an unlimited time.</p>",

While it is technically a reboot of the 2006 game of the same name developed by Human Head Studios, of which the sequel suffered a fall into development hell before the license was sold to Bethesda Softworks, there is no relation between the stories and universes of the two games.</p> <p>The game is set in the near future of an alternate reality. You find yourself stranded on the Talos I space station, invaded by hostile aliens referred to as the Typhon. To survive, you must explore Talos I in search of weapons and resources to fight off the invaders. Along the way, you&#39;ll use neural modification devices to learn skills and psychic abilites.</p> <p>Prey&#39;s gameplay loop takes heavy inspiration from System Shock and Bioshock. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay and its atmosphere. Prey received one paid DLC extension called Mooncrash which introduced a roguelite mode and a free update called Typhon Hunter which introduced a multiplayer mode inspired by classic prop hunt.</p>",

The gameplay is made in a traditional fighting 2.5D manner: battles occur in a 2D perspective but all the characters and objects are 3D. All fights are held in one-on-one form, where each participant has two life scales. Game mechanics are simple: three different types of hits and a special ability are available for each character. Some on-map objects are interactive and can be also used in attack. The main action takes place in a universe, which is parallel to a DC’s one, so occasionally clashes may look unusual. According to the storyline, Superman established dictatorship on Earth, and several Justice League members started resisting him. In the game, players are able to take control of favourite DC heroes and to participate in a war between Superman’s domination and the rebellion led by Batman. The Ultimate Edition offers players 6 new characters, over 30 new skins, and 60 new S.T.A.R. Labs missions. <br /> Injustice: Gods Among Us is followed by the sequel Injustice 2.</p>",

Matches are held on 3 main maps of a large size (Erangel, Miramar, and Sanhok). Each match has 100 participants fighting for themselves. The battle begins with players making the leap out of the plane to spread out across the map and to gather all possible equipment required for survival. Then, after a while, game intelligence randomly sets a circle shape safe zone, which gamers must reach to stay alive, and marks it on the map. Gear and resources are scattered throughout the map, so players can grab everything they need while running to the zone. Therefore, the main action comes out of the players’ collision on their ways to the circle. You can join the fight either alone or in a team (up to 4 people). Due to the customization system, lots of clothing items and weapon skins could be both bought on the marketplace and found in crates. However, in-app purchases don’t actually affect the gameplay.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dishonored is the game about stealth. Or action and killing people. It is you who will decide what to do with your enemies. You play as Corvo Attano, Empress&#39; bodyguard, a masterful assassin and a combat specialist. All of a sudden, a group of assassins kill the Empress and kidnaps her daughter Emily. Being accused of murder and waiting for execution in a cell, Corvo still manages to escape with the help of the Loyalists and their leader Admiral Havelock. Now it is your duty to return the Empress daughter and restore your name. The main focus of the game is to give the player a choice. You can spare the lives of your enemies by knocking them out or making others do the job for you or brutally murder everyone in the city. Gadgets are given by Piero Joplin, Loyalists engineer and by the Outsider, who gives Corvo magical abilities. The game reacts to your choices - grim atmosphere by itself can be turned even darker by killing people or slightly lighter by not doing so. It is only a player&#39;s choice what to do with his abilities. Basing on these actions the game will give you with two different endings of the story.</p>",

She suffers from a growing psychosis after her lover Dillion was brutally murdered by Vikings. Carrying his severed head, Senua sets out to Helheim, the underworld of the dead, to bring her lover&#39;s soul back. Her grim and bloody journey mirrors her descent into madness. It becomes increasingly difficult for her (and, thus, the player) to tell fact from fantasy, as she hears voices in her head and sees hallucinations. </p> <p>When not fighting her enemies, Senua has to solve puzzles to move forward. This is where her distorted perception actually comes out handy, enabling her to &quot;focus&quot; and see what regular people can not. The ghostly voices, recorded using the binaural method to create an eery effect, also help to guide Senua or to warn her about dangers. All of Senua movements, expressions and reactions were recorded through motion capture to make them more realistic and emotional.</p>",

In the game there are various innovations - in the plot, in the characters, in the scenarios of missions and in the setting. For example, on the Pandora satellite, gravity is much weaker, but there is no oxygen at all. Therefore, the task of obtaining oxygen becomes very important for everyone. Moreover, oxygen is needed not only for breathing, but also for the functioning of personal jetpacks and long high jumps. In the game there is another additional story and downloadable content, including new characters and story campaigns.</p>",

The game exploits pretty similar mechanic to Minecraft - randomly generated world, surviving as a top priority for the gamer. With the only difference - if you die, you die. Permanent death of your characters increases the grim and tense atmosphere of the game itself, making the process challenging and creepy. Just remember. Don&#39;t Starve.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Journey is an indie game placed in a setting of the vast desert. The protagonist is a nameless and speechless figure moving towards the distant mountain. The player gets to know the story without words, but rather through cutscenes. The main character wears a magical scarf, which allows flying for some time, and recharges it with gathered cloth or simply by walking. From time to time the protagonist finds collectible items and discover ruins that can give additional information about the world or the storyline. The only way of interaction with in-game objects is a shout. </p> <p>The game transfers the atmosphere of an absolute loneliness. However, during the journey the character can meet other players controlling differently dressed, but generally the same figures. Wandering together can be helpful for both players, as they are able to charge one another’s scarves. The thing is that both players cannot communicate each other in any way, except producing noises. Together players can complete levels and continue moving to their final destination.</p>",

And not only people. There are mutated people there, and mutated animals. They are distinguished by unusual abilities, but even more - behaviour strategies. In the struggle for the remnants of resources, all these beings spend their gloomy days.<br /> All characters use unusual and unexpected means for life and war. Something is created from the remnants of a past, normal life, something has already appeared in a new, changed world.<br /> Locations are struck by an unusual synthesis of the ruins of a known world and traces of a catastrophe.<br /> From the previous game Metro: Last Light differs, according to general opinion, by careful work on the remarks and shortcomings of the previous game. The set of weapons is significantly expanded, the technologies of Metro 2033 have become more developed.<br /> The game has two fundamentally different endings and five additions.</p>",

Originated as a mod for Half-Life, the developers were signed by Valve Corporation thus beginning the franchise that exists to this very day. </p> <p>Having no particular plot or story at all, Counter-Strike was a competitive game mostly used as PvP. With new physics and a large amount of weaponry, you can choose between two fractions - Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists. Each team had their signature weapon (CTs had M16 while T had AK-47, for example), the main goal of every round was to kill the opposite team or fulfil a task. In case there is a bomb plant - detonate or prevent, hostages - rescue or prevent from it or assassination. One player from the team is chosen as a VIP person that must be protected, and the goal of the opposite team is to kill this VIP. By winning every round, you received a good payment, by loosing - much lesser one. You can spend cash on buying equipment and weapon. Counter-Strike franchise is still loved to this day, and even such old shooters live to this day.</p>",

Among the other features: high-res textures and a set of Protector Trials, which can give the player freakish weaponry and ammunition.</p>",

Before you can fight monsters, they need to be tracked down using Scout flies and studied to discover their habits, strengths, and weaknesses. There are no character levels, so your hunter’s effectiveness relies on the hunting gear you have equipped. Advanced armor and weapons can be created using a detailed crating system.

    "description": "<p>Heavy Metal is a way of life and a world in itself, but Eddie Riggs found the real one, after the accident during a concert left him crushed by the scenery and making the involuntary blood sacrifice to the Ormagöden. The action adventure game with the real-time strategy elements in the open world introduced a star voice cast, compiled by musicians that became prototypes for some of the characters players will encounter during the game. Aside from the main story, players will be able to encounter dozens of side missions that may vary from the defense battles to a race. When using his V-guitar named Clementine, Eddie can cast spells, called Solos, by a simple rhythm game, reminiscent of Guitar Hero. Some story missions are so-called Battles of the Bands, where players will fight the armies in a real-time strategy fashion, and winning by outperforming the enemy band and destroying the stage.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a story about teamwork. Having a very curious setup, the story follows two brothers on a quest. With their mother dead and father being heavily ill, the only way to save is to bring water from the Tree of Life. But on their way, they will have to challenge the world and themselves. Villages, mountains and forests, bullies, trolls and wolves will await Naiee and Naia on their journey. </p> <p>With having such setup, the game found a perfect way to portray this world to the audience. The beautiful visual style and something in between adventure and a platformer make the game an exciting experience. Although that is not the most curious thing about the game. With having two brothers involved in a story, the game actually gives you an opportunity to control both of them. You can solve puzzles by simultaneously moving both of the characters. For example, one of your heroes must distract an enemy, and another is supposed to go behind. This amazing feature provides you with one of the most unique experiences as you play two characters at once.</p>",

Players assume roles of four people Ethan Mars, Norman Jayden, Madison Paige, and Scott Shelby somehow involved in the case of Origami Killer, who is used to leave his victims alone, marked with origami figures. It soon reveals that all Origami Killer’s murders are connected with weather changes (actually heavy rains). In the course of the completion, players will follow the characters on their way to the key of the murderer’s mystery. Heavy Rain is an unusual action-adventure game. All four main characters are controlled from the third-person perspective with only several buttons, as the interaction with the environment is usually done by activating on-screen prompts like holding the trigger, pushing a button, positioning the stick, or all in one. The gameplay consists of multiple scenes, which affect the further in-game progress by the players’ choice and create a branching storyline that can lead to various endings including the death of certain main characters.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is the latest installment in the Resident Evil series. For 13 long years, Resident Evil series were rejecting the survival-horror aspect and atmosphere of first original games in the series mainly released in nineties on PlayStation one system. From the famous Resident Evil 4 until Resident Evil 6, the series went full-force into action genre leaving horror elements behind and hard-core fans disappointed. Finally, Capcom realized that Resident Evil needs a change and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard delivers those changes at its fullest. First of all, the camera angle changed from over the shoulder view into first-person mode. Another change is that survival-horror elements are back together with light puzzle solving, inventory management and maze-like mansion in which the main story of the game happens. The player controls Ethan Winters who is searching for his lost wife in a dark mansion filled with horrible creatures and insane family. <br /> Resident Evil 7: Biohazard can also be played with virtual reality setup and it’s known as one of the best games which supports VR.</p>",

The world of the game is open, infinitely wide, and procedurally generated. It is composed of small 3D cubes that represent specific types of materials or terrain. The gameplay is centered on mining and building various structures of your choice. You can also craft items like tools, weapons, and armor. There&#39;s an option to shift to the first or the third person view.<br /> Minecraft includes multiple modes that dramatically change the focus of the game. Survival and Adventure modes require the player to gather resources, hunt for food and fight monsters to survive. In the Hardcore mode, there’s even permanent death. Creative mode, by contrast, offers you to freely explore the world and construct whatever you want with unlimited resources. There’s also a multiplayer mode that allows the players to share their worlds and engage in the traditional MMO activities, such as player-vs-player combat.<br /> Minecraft’s crude visual style, reminiscent of Lego cubes, became an iconic part of the popular culture. There are many myths and fan fiction surrounding the game, such as the legend of Herobrine, a rumored character that officially doesn’t exist.</p>",

Players have to zone the city, build roads, explore the surroundings, provide infrastructure and jobs to attract new citizens. Once the newcomers settle down, the immediate reaction is expected to establish public services and to set proper taxes. Progressing within the game and developing the city will unlock new upgrades of the urban environment and lead to the territorial expansion. The gameplay also requires the control of several city’s parameter scales like budget, health, employment, and pollution. The game also features a creative sandbox mode, where the architect’s imagination is not restricted in any way.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mafia II is the second game in the franchise about Italian mafia operating in America after World War II. Vito Scalleta returns from the war in Italy being wounded. As he returns and reunites with his friend Joe, he and Henry Tomassino convince Vito to be apart of an Italian mafia in fictional city Empire Bay. Starting to work for Alberto Clemente, Vito must go through every aspect of being a part of the family and become a big thing in it.</p> <p>Even though the game has an open world mechanic, you won&#39;t probably explore it. Travelling to missions give an opportunity to listen to music of this time in America - Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Dean Martin and others, providing the game with a great atmosphere of the USA in its 50s. The gameplay has a variety of missions to offer, in which you can confront your enemies in melee combat, shoot them with different guns like M1911 or Thompson, or stealthily engaging your opponents. The game is pretty strict to the player reaching highest of empathy with Vito and every situation he&#39;s in.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Return of the classic FPS, Doom (2016) acts as a reboot of the series and brings back the Doomslayer, protagonist of the original Doom games. In order to solve the energy crisis, humanity learned to harvest the energy from Hell, and when something went wrong and a demon invasion has started, it’s up to the player to control the Doomslayer and destroy the evil.</p> <p>Doom is a fast-paced game that restores the concept of instant health packs and leaves the player against armies of Hell with no cover, no health regeneration, or help from anyone. After damaging monsters enough, they will start glowing, which will allow players to perform glory kills to restore some health. While exploring the levels, players will come across secrets, collectible items, or upgrade points for the weapons and armor. The single-player campaign silent protagonist has a noticeable personality. He gets visibly annoyed and angry in his actions during expository cutscenes and forces his way through the game. Multiplayer maps gather players in Deathmatch/”king-of-the-hill” type game modes, with all the weapons from the single-player campaign.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The fourth game in the post-apocalyptic action RPG series from Bethesda studious brings players back to the retro-future. After customizing the facial features of the character, players will be admitted to the Vault 111 with their family, and tricked into entering the cryogenic capsule. After the rude awakening after the unknown amount of time has passed, the child is separated from the parents and the loving partner is killed in front of them – the main quest is settled. Now there’s only the giant open world to explore. Fallout 4 introduces the mechanics of settlement building, where players can build their own little town. Gathering material for crafting and building brings more “survival” elements into the old formula. Within their own settlements, players will be able to build all needed utilities, from storage spaces to power armor stations. Visual upgrade from the previous game brings life to what used to be brown wastelands, now filled with details and color.</p>",

    "description": "<p>It is a new beginning for Kratos. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, he ventures into the brutal Norse wilds with his son Atreus, fighting to fulfill a deeply personal quest. </p> <p>His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. </p> <p>Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. </p> <p>From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. </p> <p>With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre</p>",
